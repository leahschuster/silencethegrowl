          <p>A donation of $5 provides 1 backpack. Generous donors like you have already provided 386 children with backpacks!</p>

          <p>PepsiCo is donating $1 for every 3 shares across your networks. Same goes for every 3 follows of UWMD’s social channels!</p>
          <p>Your $25 donation provides 5 backpacks to a child in need. Given monthly, you’d provide enough food to care for 5 children all summer long.</p>
